    <img src="c385eo5qiow11.jpg" width="350" height="500">

    <h2>Doc and what he offers as an operator</h2>
    <p>Doc (real name Gustave Kateb) is a Defender operator in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, known for his healing and reviving abilities. He was introduced in Operation Dust Line (Year 1, Season 2) as part of the GIGN (French National Gendarmerie Intervention Group) unit. His role revolves around providing support to his team by using his medical expertise to heal or revive teammates during intense firefights. Doc's primaries are the SG-CQB, MP5, and the P90. The secondaries are the Bailiff 410, LFP586, and the P9. The utilities he possesses are Barbed Wire, and a Bulletproof Camera.</p>

    <h2>Doc's description and accomplishments</h2>
    <p>Doc was introduced in Operation Dust Line (Year 1, Season 2). He is part of the GIGN (French National Gendarmerie Intervention Group), a counter-terrorism unit known for its specialized training in high-risk operations. Doc is a medical expert, offering essential support to his team through his healing and reviving abilities. Doc was a highly skilled medic who served in GIGN. As a trained field surgeon, he brings his medical expertise to the battlefield, where his primary role is to keep his teammates alive during dangerous operations. His extensive medical knowledge allows him to perform life-saving actions, both on and off the field.</p>

    <h2>Why Doc is part of our Top 3 siege operators</h2>
    <p>Doc's stim pistol is single-handedly one of the most useful abilities in the game purely because it can heal an ally's health to full and revive a downed player to full HP, rather than reviving them at 20 HP, making him part of the Top 3 Siege operators.</p>
