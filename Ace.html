    <h2>Ace and what he offers as an operator</h2>
    <p>Ace is an attacker operator in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege who specializes in breaching reinforced surfaces. He is known for his S.E.L.M.A. (Selective Explosive Line Charge), a unique gadget that allows him to safely create openings in reinforced walls, hatches, and barricades from a distance. His primary weapons consist of the AK-12 and the M1014 with his secondary weapon being the P9, and his utility being Breach Charges and Claymores. Ace is mainly used to hard breach into the bomb site to eliminate the enemy team or plant the defuser to win the round.</p>
    
    <h2>Ace's description and accomplishments</h2>
    <p>Ace, whose real name is Erik "Ace" Jørgensen, is a Norwegian operator in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. He was introduced in Operation Demon Veil (Year 6, Season 1).
    Ace is a highly skilled operator from the Norwegian GIGN (Grenzenessk Kompaniet, Norway's special forces unit). Prior to joining Rainbow, he had extensive experience in both combat and breaching operations, which made him an ideal candidate for the role of an attacker.</p>
    
    <h2>Why Ace is our Top 3</h2>
    <p>Ace is one of our Top 3 Siege operators because he provides incredible amounts of support to the team while also being capable of defeating an entire team of enemies all by himself with powerful weapons at his disposal, making him part of the Top 3 Siege operators.</p>
